# scriptoolery

Welcome to **scriptoolery**, an experimental workshop for scripts and utilities in development. Here, new ideas are prototyped and refined before they graduate to the polished **scriptorium** repository.

## Structure

- **alpha/**: For early-stage tools and experimental scripts.
- **beta/**: Nearly stable scripts, still under testing.

This is a space for exploration and innovationâ€”feel free to contribute or experiment!
