# Scriptoolery - Alpha

The **alpha** directory within **scriptoolery** houses experimental and prototype scripts that are currently under testing or in early development stages. These tools are functional but may still be evolving, making them suitable for adventurous users looking to try out new utilities or provide feedback.

## Structure

Each script in the **alpha** directory is organized into its own folder with the following structure:

- **Script Folder**: Contains the main script file along with any dependencies.
- **README.md**: Each script folder includes a README with detailed usage instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting tips.
- **LICENSE**: Licensing information, typically the BSD 2-Clause License, is included with each script.

## Contents

- **beepamac**: A Mac locator alert script designed to help find a Mac by playing a continuous alert sound, especially useful in remote setups. This script is configurable for remote compatibility and works on systems with `afplay` or `osascript` available. See `alpha/beepamac/README.md` for full details.
